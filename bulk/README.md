Step 1_qc: Quality control was performed using fastp.    
Step 2_gene_salmon: Gene expression quantification was performed using Salmon.    
Step 3_ExplorATE: Locus-level transposable element (TE) quantification was performed using ExplorATE(https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac354, https://github.com/FemeniasM/ExplorATEproject.git).    
Downstream differential analysis can be performed using tools such as DESeq2 or edgeR.You can find a more detailed example here.(https://femeniasm.github.io/ExplorATE_vignette/)
