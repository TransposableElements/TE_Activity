# TE_Activity
This is a pipeline that enables transposable element (TE) quantification at both the bulk and single-cell levels, covering the full workflow from upstream FASTQ processing to downstream analyses such as batch correction and differential analysis.

## Short description
For the target species, TE reference annotations can be obtained from UCSC or RepeatMasker () and manually processed into BED format as needed.
